                  <p class="question">What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</p>
                  <p class="answer">The first thing I noticed and paid attention to on the website was its strong emphasis on graphic design and typography. I then noticed that the text would also change based on interaction with the website. A small attention to detail I noticed that I really enjoyed was seeing my mouse create a sentence trail as I hovered over the title text.</p>
              </div>  
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</p>
                <p class="answer">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Clicked on the website to activate sound</li>
                    <li>Moved mouse around to play with the interaction on the website title</li>
                    <li>Scrolled to further the website story </li>
                    <li>Clicked through video timeline segments </li>
                    <li>Continued scrolling to view further the story </li>
                  </ul>
                </div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</p>
                <p class="answer">I spent the most time on the scrolling interaction with the website, going up and down to see it interact with video playback and the way text morphs in and out of the screen as well as the informative text and visuals.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</p>
                <p class="answer">My most common interaction with the website was scrolling. Most of the experience was scrolling to continue the story the website was telling. The second most common action I would say is mouse movement to see the dynamic movements of the webpage.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</p>
                <p class="answer">The primary goal of the website based on my experience with it was to tell the story of the Walt Disney Concert Hall in an immersive and engaging way.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</p>
                <p class="answer">The interactive experience communicates this goal through the various different methods in which it tells its story. Through text, imagery and video, the experience presents to the user an engaging experience that makes you want to know more. Each nugget of information is given space to present itself, never giving too much at once so that the experience is never overwhelming. This results in the user wanting to stay longer to engage with the experience and learn more.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</p>
                <p class="answer">To me it seems that the website Is intended to be interacted with a single time in either a single sitting until the user has finished the story or a few. This is because I noticed that the website doesn’t have much navigational design other than the chapters and is a single page with scrolling being the main navigation. This would mean that it would be hard for the user to find certain parts again if they were to go through the website again, leading me to believe that it’s intended to only be experienced once. It also feels like there’s more form over function within the website as they could have presented the information in a much more systematic and straightforward way, but they instead opted for a novel design that would grab new viewers attentions. </div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</p>
                <p class="answer">On the first page of the website it explicitly communicates how it should be interacted with through the text ‘scroll for story’. This is the only information necessary to navigate the page, and you could go through the entire experience by only scrolling. It’s intended that each person can do this at their own pace as things will only move forward and progress if the user wants to.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</p>
                <p class="answer">The experience references graphical design, videos, photos as well as 360 images. These are all seamlessly integrated into the website and reveal themselves smoothly, as you naturally scroll through the page. No element feels out of place.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</p>
                <p class="answer">The steady stream of media coming and going communicates to me what I should be paying attention at that point in time based on where I am in the story. Occasionally media elements will take up the entire screen indicating to me its importance and that I should stop and look at it. Combined with text, it provides an engaging experience for the user.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</p>
                <p class="answer">The references the site presents communicates to me that I should be feeling engaged and immersed in the experience, due to the size of the elements presented on screen. It leaves no space for anything else on the screen.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</p>
                <p class="answer">The most frustrating part of the interaction would be how at moments, the experience forces you to scroll through screen sized text which are often hard to read simply so that you could get to the next section of the story. There’s an assumption from the designers that you want to engage with every part of the website, which may not be true for everyone, resulting in basically hijacked interactions. This doesn’t just occur with the titles, it also happens with the media elements as well, often requiring you to scroll multiple times so that you could get past it into the next part.</div>
              <div class="box">
                <p class="question">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</p>
                <p class="answer">I found the most satisfying part of the experience to be how scrolling would result in dynamic movements on the page, through the title typography stretching and squishing, background video playback and the swipe style reveals of the next portions, even if it does get in the way of the experience sometimes.</div>
